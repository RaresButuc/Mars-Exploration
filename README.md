# Mars Exploration 2

## Project Description 
The "Mars Exploration" Java project is a simulation where a rover is dispatched to explore a specific area on Mars. Equipped with sophisticated sensors and navigation capabilities, the rover's primary objective is to locate essential resources required for human survival. Every step of the rover is marked inside a report and once it identifies and gathers these vital resources, it sends the report to the Earth approving a future colonization.

### Technologies Used
- Java - This application was entirely made using Java programming language;
- SQLite - Inside one DB, datas about every aspect of the exploration were stored;

### Challenges
- Working with coordinates inside a String Map instead of an array of arrays;
- Thinking the Outcome Results depending on the mission analysis results regarding the found resources;

### Future Plans
- Adding multiple rovers for a bigger surface to study;
- Create a command center;

### Setup
- Just clone the project and simply press the "Run Application.java" button.

### How to Use
- After the project was cloned and the "Run" button was pressed,you should see details about 3 different attempts of exploration:
1. The first aspect that appears in the console above all is a "Legend" section of all elements that will appear on schemas:
